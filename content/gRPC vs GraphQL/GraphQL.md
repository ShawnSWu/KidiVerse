## Key Features of GraphQL

*   **Reduced Over-fetching:** Clients request only the specific data fields they need, preventing the retrieval of excessive data.
*   **Fewer Network Requests:** A single request can fetch multiple related resources, minimizing network round-trips.
*   **Decoupled Frontend and Backend:** Defines a clear query language and interface, allowing clients to evolve independently of the backend implementation.
*   **Strong Typing System:** Supports the definition of complex objects and ensures type safety.
*   **Powerful Caching Mechanisms:** Queries can be naturally cached, avoiding redundant requests for previously fetched data.
*   **Eliminates Need for Multiple Endpoints for Different Data Views:** A single query can flexibly retrieve complete information, reducing the need for numerous specialized API endpoints.
*   **Progressive API Adoption:** Clients are not required to adopt GraphQL wholesale immediately; migration can be done incrementally.
