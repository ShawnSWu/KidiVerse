# Pod! 

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.  
Think of it as a wrapper that holds one or more tightly-coupled containers sharing:

- **Network namespace** – they all see the same `localhost`.
- **Storage volumes** – optional persistent or ephemeral volumes.
- **Lifecycle** – scheduled, started, and stopped together.
