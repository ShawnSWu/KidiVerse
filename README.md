# KidiVerse ‚Äì AI-Enhanced Hugo Note Theme

KidiVerse is a **Hugo static-site theme for Obsidian-style Markdown notebooks**.
It respects the typical Obsidian convention where **images live in an `attachments/` sub-folder** next to each note, and automatically resolves those links.
On top of a clean two-column dark layout, it ships with an **AI-powered semantic knowledge graph** that lets you explore relationships between notes visually.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* Two-column dark UI ‚Äì collapsible sidebar auto-reads your `content/` tree
* Obsidian-style images ‚Äì write `![alt](image.png)` and KidiVerse serves it automatically from `attachments/`
* AI semantic graph ‚Äì SentenceTransformers + k-NN ‚Üí interactive D3 force-directed graph (`/graph`)
* GitHub Actions integration ‚Äì graph data (`static/data/notes_graph.json`) is rebuilt on **every deploy**
* Fully client-side, no external APIs required at runtime

## üìù Note-Taking Conventions

1. **Directory = Topic** ‚Äì organise notes under `content/<topic>/<Note>.md`
2. **Attachments** ‚Äì place images related to each note in `content/<topic>/attachments/`
3. Insert images simply as:
   ```markdown
   ![my diagram](diagram.png)        # resolves to /<topic>/attachments/diagram.png
   ![[diagram.png]]                  # Obsidian transclusion also works
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My Knowledge Garden"

[params]
  description = "Personal Zettelkasten powered by KidiVerse"
```

(Advanced parameters such as colours, fonts, sidebar width are documented in `exampleSite/config.toml`.)

---

## ü§ñ AI Semantic Graph

* **Script:** `scripts/build_graph.py`
  * Generates sentence embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  * Computes top-k nearest neighbours with scikit-learn
  * Writes `static/data/notes_graph.json` consumed by the front-end
* **Front-end:** `static/js/graph.js` renders an interactive force graph with D3.

### GitHub Action
A ready-made workflow (`.github/workflows/build-graph.yml`) runs the script on every push / deploy:

```yaml
autocomplete: false
name: Build semantic graph
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "development" ]
jobs:
  graph:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install deps
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Build graph
        run: python scripts/build_graph.py
      - name: Upload artifact (optional)
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: graph
          path: static/data/notes_graph.json
```

Feel free to adapt ‚Äì e.g. commit the JSON back, deploy to Netlify, etc.
