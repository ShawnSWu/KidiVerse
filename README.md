# KidiVerse – AI-Enhanced Hugo Note Theme

KidiVerse is a **Hugo static-site theme for Obsidian-style Markdown notebooks**.
It respects the typical Obsidian convention where **images live in an `attachments/` sub-folder** next to each note, and automatically resolves those links.
It offers a clean two-column dark layout that mirrors your folder structure and scales gracefully from small personal wikis to large knowledge gardens.

## ✨ Features

* Two-column dark UI – collapsible sidebar auto-reads your `content/` tree
* Obsidian-style images – write `![alt](image.png)` and make sure the image is in the `attachments/`.
* AI semantic graph – SentenceTransformers + k-NN → interactive D3 force-directed graph (`/graph`)
* GitHub Actions integration – graph data (`static/data/notes_graph.json`) is rebuilt on **every deploy**
* Fully client-side, no external APIs required at runtime

Already keeping your notes in an Obsidian vault? Just copy them into `content/` and you’re ready to go:

1. **Drag-and-drop folders** – every folder becomes a sidebar section.
2. **Add an `_index.md`** (Very important, please do it otherwise the folder will not be displayed on your sidebar) in each folder so Hugo can render the section landing page & sidebar entry. 

A minimal example:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Git"   # folder label in sidebar
   weight: 2       # optional ordering (lower = higher)
   ---
   ```

   (You can create these quickly with a script or your file manager.)
3. Keep images in the folder’s `attachments/` sub-directory – the theme will resolve links like `![diagram](diagram.png)` automatically.
4. Start `hugo server ‑D` and enjoy the same Obsidian structure with a searchable website + AI knowledge graph.

## 📝 Note-Taking Conventions

1. **Directory = Topic** – organise notes under `content/<topic>/<Note>.md`
2. **Attachments** – place images related to each note in `content/<topic>/attachments/`
3. Insert images simply as:
   ```markdown
   ![my diagram](diagram.png)        # resolves to /<topic>/attachments/diagram.png
   ![[diagram.png]]                  # Obsidian transclusion also works
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My Knowledge Garden"

[params]
  description = "Personal Zettelkasten powered by KidiVerse"
```

(Advanced parameters such as colours, fonts, sidebar width are documented in `exampleSite/config.toml`.)

## 🤖 AI Semantic Graph

* **Script:** `scripts/build_graph.py`
  * Generates sentence embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  * Computes top-k nearest neighbours with scikit-learn
  * Writes `static/data/notes_graph.json` consumed by the front-end
* **Front-end:** `static/js/graph.js` renders an interactive force graph with D3.

### GitHub Action
A ready-made workflow (`.github/workflows/knowledge-graph.yml`) runs the script on every push / deploy:

Feel free to adapt – e.g. commit the JSON back, deploy to Netlify, etc.
